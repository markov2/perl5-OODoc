=chapter NAME

OODoc::Object - base class for all OODoc classes.

=chapter SYNOPSIS

  # Never instantiated directly.

=chapter DESCRIPTION

Any object used in the OODoc module is derived from this OODoc::Object
class.  This means that all functionality in this class is provided
for all of the other classes.

=chapter OVERLOADED

=overload  '==' (numeric equivalent)
Numeric comparison is used to compare to objects whether they are
identical.  On many extensions, string comparison is overloaded to
compare the names of the objects.

=overload  '!=' (numeric different)
Results in true when the objects are different

=overload 'bool'
Always returns true: "exists".
=cut

use overload
	'=='   => sub {$_[0]->unique == $_[1]->unique},
	'!='   => sub {$_[0]->unique != $_[1]->unique},
	'bool' => sub {1};

#--------------------
=chapter METHODS

=section Constructors

=c_method new %options

Create a new object (instantiation).  All objects in OODoc are created
the same way: they carry a list of key-value pairs as option.  For
examples, see the description of this method in the manual page of
the specific object.

The validity of the options for C<new> is checked, in contrary to the
options when used with many other method defined by OODoc.

=error unknown object attribute '$name' for $pkg
You have used the option with $name, which is not defined with the
instantiation (the C<new> method) of this object.

=error unknown object attributes for $pkg: '$names'
You have used more than one option which is not defined to instantiate
the object.

=cut

sub new(@)
{	my ($class, %args) = @_;
	my $self = (bless {}, $class)->init(\%args);

	if(my @missing = keys %args)
	{	error __xn"unknown object attribute '{names}' for {pkg}", "unknown object attributes for {pkg}: {names}",
			scalar @missing, names => \@missing, pkg => $class;
	}

	$self;
}

my $unique = 42;

sub init($)
{	my ($self, $args) = @_;

	# prefix with 'id', otherwise confusion between string and number
	$self->{OO_unique} = 'id' . $unique++;
	$self;
}

#--------------------
=section Attributes

=method unique
Returns a unique id for this text item.  This is the easiest way to
see whether two references to the same (overloaded) objects point to
the same thing. The ids are numeric.

=example
  if($obj1->unique == $obj2->unique) {...}
  if($obj1 == $obj2) {...}   # same via overload

=cut

sub unique() { $_[0]->{OO_unique} }

=method publish \%options
Extract the data of an object for export, and register it in the index.
A HASH is returned which should get filled with useful data.
=cut

my %index;
sub publish($)
{	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	$index{$self->unique} = +{ id => $self->unique };
}

=method publicationIndex
Returns the collected objects for publication.
=cut

sub publicationIndex() { \%index }
